Hello Code You, 42 year old female, married for 20 years with 2 children.  ![244423572_10225666395356671_5743401532338366519_n](https://github.com/lesliehughes0921/hello-world/assets/148918494/9d2f9553-9bfd-4447-b7c7-6f0de42efc27)

Looking forward to learning something new and the possibilities of a new career to support my family 
However, I am terribly nervous about this new experience, I have a tendency to overthink processses and make things harder than they have to be.  Once I get more knowledgable about a process that is when I typically will identify shortcuts and feel more comfortable in the workflow.  Right now though, I'm not even grasping what "Markdown elements" in the work description are or how to use different ones ðŸ˜•

**Nervous doesn't touch the tip of the iceberg**

*Praying for God's favor*

**Learn by doing, keep practicing until I get it !!**

A few months in not completely understanding everything but it's coming together
